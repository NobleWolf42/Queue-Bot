!!Needs To be rewritten in disscord.js

If you would like to help in the development of this bot, the discord is https://discord.gg/tgJtK7f.

Uses discord.io and winston (winston is for a debug logger, unneeded for final code)

Install Commands for Dependancies:
- npm install discord.io winston â€“save
- npm install https://github.com/woor/discord.io/tarball/gateway_v6

You will have to change some variables for your own use, copy the `config.example.json` to `config.json` and enter your settings.
